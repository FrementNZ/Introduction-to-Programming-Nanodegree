        <h2>Setting up</h2>
<ol>
          <li>What does building a web page entail? Well, you’ll first be writing code in <em>HTML</em> – or HyperText Markup Language – and then visualizing the resulting web page as it’s rendered by a <em>web browser</em>.</li>
          <li>To get started on your own computer, you’ll need <b>two</b> tools going forward:<br/><br/>
            <ul>
              <li>Some place to write and save your code, and.</li>
              <li>A web browser to view the rendered result.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
          <li>You’ll be writing and saving your code with something called a text editor. A text editor is just a piece of software that allows programmers to compose, edit, and save code – just as we might use “Microsoft Word” to edit text in natural language.</li>
          <li>Word Processor vs. Text Editor<br/><br/>
            <ul>
              <li>Word processor – software that allows us to compose, edit, and save text in <b>natural languages (like English, Spanish, Etc.)</b>. Examples of word processors: Microsoft Word, Pages, Open Office writer.</li>
              <li>Text Editor – software that allows us to compose, edit, and save text in <b>computer languages (like Python, C, etc.)</b>. Examples of text editors: Atom, Sublime Text, Brackets.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class= "image">
              <li class ="images"><img src= "images/word.png" alt= "word.png could not be displayed"></li>
              <li class ="images"><img src ="images/text.png" alt= "text.png could not be displayed"></li>
      </ul>
          <li>There are numerous text editors available for free download online, but most of them offer similar functionality. For example, one useful feature that’s common across editors is what we refer to as <b>syntax highlighting</b>, or the use of colours to format code and make it more readable. Here are some examples of commonly used text editors:
<br/><br/>
            <ul>
            <li>Atom (recommended)</li>
            <li>Sublime Text</li>
            <li>Brackets</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
</ol>

<h2>Building your First Web Page </h2>
<ol>
<li>With your text editor installed, you’re now ready to open it up and start writing code. Here, you’ll be writing in <b>HTML</b>, and that means you’ll need to save your code <b>as an HTML file</b>. Note that this is an important point! In order for a browser to be able to interpret your HTML code and render it as a web page, the file name <b>must</b> end with the appropriate extension of <span style ="color:red;">.html</span>. That’s why we use a text editor (instead of a word processor) to write code – it allows us to save files in a particular format that suits our needs.</li>
<li>So, let’s do that. Follow these steps to write and save HTML Code:<br/><br/>
    <ol type ="a">
    <li>Open your text editor so that you’re looking at a blank file. (Note: Some editors give you the option of clicking through a welcome tutorial before you see this blank file).</li>
    <li>Type the following code (exactly as shown) into the blank file:<br/><br/>
    <span style ="color:cyan;">well, why <b>wouldn’t</b> I learn to code?</span></li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Save your code as an HTML file by navigating to the menu bar, selection <span style="color:red;">File</span> > <span style="color:red;">Save As</span>.., and giving the file a name like <span style="color:red;">my-first-code.html</span>. Note the location on your computer you’re saving this file. Then, hit the <span style ="color:red;">Save</span> button.</li>
<li>It’s now time to view the rendered web page in a browser like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. There are a couple of ways you can do this:
<br/><br/>
    <ol type ="a">
    <li>You can find the HTML file on your computer and double-click on it to open it. (On Mac, you can use the Finder to reach the file location, and on Windows, you can use My Computer). Most often, your computer will be set up to open the HTML file in your default web browser. If, however, this doesn’t happen, you can simple right-click on the file, and choose to open it in a browser by selecting, for example, <span style ="color:red;">Open With</span> > <span style ="color:red;">Google Chrome</span>.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can open up a web browser and then open your HTML file directly through the browser’s interface. In Chrome, for instance, this would involve navigating to the menu bar and selecting <span style="color:red;">File</span> > <span style="color:red;">Open File</span>. You’d then select the HTML file that you saved on your computer and click <span style ="color:red;">Open</span> to view the rendered web page in your browser window.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Note: If you make changes to your HTML code using your text editor, those changes will <em><b>only</b></em> be reflected in your browser’s rendered web page if you do <em><b>two</b></em> things
<br/><br/>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>You must first <b>save</b> your changes to the HTML file (in your text editor, <span style="color:red;">File</span> > <span style="color:red;">Save</span>).</li>
    <li>You must then <b>refresh</b> the web page to render the modified HTML file.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
